# liriBot

If the user has this project on their machine and is in Git Bash they can use it via the following methods:

To start:
No matter which API the user wants to call, they will need to be in the project file in Git Bash and enter - node liri.js -

Below are the commands for each API to be queried after entering node liri.js:

- Bands in Town: concert-this "name of the artist to search for"

- Spotfify: spotify-this-song "name of the song to search for"

- OMDB: movie-this "name of the movie to search for"

- Random command: do-what-it-says

Where users can get help with your project?
There is an attached video link that will walk the user through doing each API call.
